I learned about PARALLAX WEBSITE, it deal with "perspective" in CSS to apply 3-Dimensional properties in your website to make it more professional.

Parallax scrolling, which creates a sense of depth on your site, is powerful because it is so engaging.

In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background typically moves much more slowly,
giving the illusion of depth.
Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a fascinating and seamless virtual experience.
