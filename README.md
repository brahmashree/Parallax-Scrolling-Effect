I learned about PARALLAX WEBSITE, which was very well explained by Love Babbar(Code Help). I've learned 3-D Transformation, 3-D Preserve, and a lot more.

Parallax scrolling, which creates a sense of depth on your site, is powerful because it is so engaging.

In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background typically moves much more slowly,
giving the illusion of depth.
Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a fascinating and seamless virtual experience.
